   Description: 
   A running list of items of work that need to be done

***************************************************************************

TODO:

overall:
-Put in MORE UNIT TESTING!!
-Write test cases for codebase and installed items!!!!
-Install BDM client and simple sanity check call(s)
-Build Shell (REPL)

core:
Metrics & Monitoring
 ->Put in Query "LIMIT" clause at the end of each query to a configurable value
 ->For Monitoring put in time series results in fixed size LRU cache
-Remove faux 'gateway' from codebase.
-Put in XML Parsing of Payload message data (the catalog)
 ->Test xjc ant task and building stubs
 -> Have to get or make catalog specific XSD to JAXB on.

-Find out from Bob what the deal is/was with hessian to see if I can
safely upgrade to using 3.1.5 - he alluded to hacking the hessian code
on the python side for things to work... will an upgraded hessian
screw things up?

      hessian-3.0.20.jar ->? hessian-3.1.5.jar

(Note: we will move away from hessian to use RESTful - http calls.
       I [gavin] believe that using a binary protocol is more compact
       and the right thing to do - but... seems like if everyone jumps
       off the bridge... Geronimo... ;-) )
